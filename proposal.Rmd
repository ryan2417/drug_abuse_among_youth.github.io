### Motivation


### Intended Final Products
Firstly, the project will work on the findings on the state level, showing the distribution of overall youth drug use in each state, as well as the trend of youth drug use rate among races, gender, and age in each state. We would like to find states with a high incidence of youth drug use and races that have a disproportionally high rate of youth drug use. Moreover, we are interested in the average age of initial marijuana use and the rate of initial marijuana use before age 13 of each race and gender group and see how it differ among states.\
The second endpoint of the project is exploring the association between youth drug use and other health risk behaviors. We concern about whether the higher frequency of drug use is correlated with a higher rate of risky behaviors, such as driving after drinking, cell phone use while driving, wearing a seat belt when riding, carrying a weapon and physical fighting, or behaviors with potential health risk, such as early age sexual experience, suicide attempt, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, physical inactivity, underweight/overweight, video game addiction and suicide attempt.\
Finally, we focus on the difference between marijuana use and other drug use and whether there is a significant risk behaviour difference between teenagers who use marijuana and those who use other drugs.
We plan to show most of the results using tables and data visualization and a dashboard that displays some interactive plots about our results.\


### Anticipated data sources
In this project, we use data of Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) collected by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The YRBSS was developed in 1990 to monitor health behaviors that contribute markedly to the leading causes of death, disability, and social problems among youth and adults in the United States. The data are collected every two years, and the most up-to-date data were collected in 2019. We will use the data collected in 2019 on the state level.

The dataset is so large that it exceeds the upload limit of github. Therefore, in order to download the dataset, you can use the code in `download_dataset.Rmd`.
