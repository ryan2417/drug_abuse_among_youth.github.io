### Motivation


### Intended Final Products
Firstly, the project works on the findings on the state level, showing the distribution of overall youth drug use on each state, as well as the comparison of youth drug use rate between races on each state. We would like to find states with high prevalence of youth drug use and races that have disproportional high rate of youth drug use. Moreover, we are interested in the average age of initial drug use and the rate of initial marijuana use before age 13 of each race and gender group and see how these differ between states.\
The second endpoint of the project is exploring the association between youth drug use and other health and behavior variables. We are concerned about whether more frequent drug use is correlate with higher rate of risky behaviors among youth, such as driving after drinking, cell phone use while driving, wearing seat belt when riding, carrying weapon and physical fighting, or behaviors with health risk, such as early age sexual experience, suicide attempt, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, physical inactivity, underweight/overweight and suicide attempt.\
Finally, we would focus on difference between marijuana use and other drugs use.
