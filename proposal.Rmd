### Motivation


### Intended Final Products
Firstly, the project will work on the findings on the state level, showing the distribution of overall youth drug use on each state, as well as the trends of youth drug use rate among races, gender, and age on each state. We would like to find states with high incidence of youth drug use and races that have disproportional high rate of youth drug use. Moreover, we are interested in the average age of initial marijuana use and the rate of initial marijuana use before age 13 of each race and gender group and see how it differ among states.\
Second endpoint of the project is exploring the association between youth drug use and other health risk behaviors. We are concerned about whether higher frequency of drug use is correlate with higher rate of risky behaviors, such as driving after drinking, cell phone use while driving, wearing seat belt when riding, carrying weapon and physical fighting, or behaviors with potential health risk, such as early age sexual experience, suicide attempt, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, physical inactivity, underweight/overweight, video game addiction and suicide attempt.\
Finally, we are focus on difference between marijuana use and other drugs use. Whether there is a significant risk behavior difference between teenagers who use marijuana and those who use other drugs.
We plan to show most of the results using tables and data visualization and a dashboard which displaying some interactive plots about our results.\


### Anticipated data sources
In this project, we use data of Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) collected by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The YRBSS was developed in 1990 to monitor health behaviors that contribute markedly to the leading causes of death, disability, and social problems among youth and adults in the United States. The data are collected every two years, and the most up-to-date data were collected in 2019. We will use the data collected in 2019 on the state level.

The dataset is so large that it exceeds the upload limit of github. Therefore, in order to download the dataset, you can use the code in `download_dataset.Rmd`.
